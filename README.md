# Laplace-Data-Modeling
A Python program to map a 3D representation of experimental lab data on top of theoretical data 

This program is posted to exemplify how python can simplify complex data models in just a few short lines of code

The following program was created as a tool for a project to prove the Laplace equation by analyzing laboritory data
